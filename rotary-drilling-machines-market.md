<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Circulation</li><li>Reverse Circulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drilling machines operate using two primary types: normal circulation and reverse circulation. Normal circulation involves the fluid being pumped down the drill pipe, enhancing cutting removal and cooling the bit as it ascends to the surface. Conversely, reverse circulation technology pushes the drilling fluid up through the inner pipe while the cuttings are collected via the outer annular space, offering improved sample quality and reduced contamination. Both types are essential for various drilling applications, including mineral exploration and construction.</p></p>
